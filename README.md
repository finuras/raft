### Raft

A Docker extension to assist in web applications development.
- Easily set up a proxy, so that you can have multiple applications (virtual hosts).
  - Different domains are routed to different applications running in your machine.

Roadmap:
- Configure virtual hosts
- Set up local SSL certificates.
  - Not only you're mimicking the production environment, you can now also develop SSL-only browser API features.
